<p class="text-bold">The tokenomics of AVO, or Avocado Toast, is structured with intriguing and unique mechanisms to ensure growth.</p>

<p>This memecoin, powered by a sense of humor and a nod to millennial breakfast trends, boasts a supply of which 99% is deployed to a Uniswap v3 liquidity pool. This liquidity is effectively locked within the token contract, and it is protected from removal, thus providing critical stability to the token value.</p>

<p class="text-italic">The remaining 1% of the supply is distributed to the MemesOnMondays team. This ensures team motivation and gives them a vested interest in the token's success. To ensure the token's stability and growth, the team is committed to not sell more than 25% a day. It roughly takes an investment of $10k USD to launch a new memecoin - this covers the costs associated with the token's deployment, marketing strategies, developers and founder remuneration. We aim on liquidating between 50-75% over the course of each week to cover these costs, while preserving a 'moon bag'.</p>

<p class="text-small">The MemesOnMondays team is bracing itself for the thrill of launching a new memecoin each week, iterating upon previous versions and hoping to eventually create a memecoin that goes viral. As we improve and refine our processes, we dream of lambos and girlfriends, riding high on the wave of internet culture. We welcome enthusiasts and traders to join us in our exciting journey to effectively disrupt crypto markets with humor and a spirit of innovation, to become the greatest memecoin creators on planet Earth.</p>
