<p>This memecoin, powered by a sense of humor and a nod to millennial breakfast trends, boasts a supply of which 99% is deployed to a Uniswap v3 liquidity pool. This liquidity is deployed and locked within the token contract, and it is protected from removal, thus providing critical stability to the token value. Uniswap v3 uses NFT liquidity positions, the owner of liquidity is the token contract itself and there are no functions in the contract to remove or transfer it. Code is verified on Etherscan.</p>

<p class="text-small">The remaining 1% of the supply is distributed to the MemesOnMondays team. This ensures aligned motivation and gives them a vested interest in the token's success.</p>
